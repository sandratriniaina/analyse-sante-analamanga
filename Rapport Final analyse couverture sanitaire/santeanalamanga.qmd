  <abstract>Madagascar Administrative Boundaries (Updated in December 2017 by UN OCHA ROSA ) : METADATA BACKGROUND The Madagascar COD Boundary Shapefiles contain 2 sets of Codes and Names, which is unusual for a COD (UNOCHA P-Codes/Names and BNGRC Codes/Names from the National Disaster Management Agency). The reason for this is that during the previous cyclone response it was noted that the BNGRC were using different codes for Regions (administrative boundary level 1) and Districts (administrative boundary level 2) that were not in the previous COD dataset, which they link to their reports. However the BNGRC district and region codes do not correlate with the full Fokontany (Administrative Boundary Level 4) Codes, therefore over time a move should be made to work with the P-Codes where possible. It is however important that the COD�s are in line with the data used by the BNGRC, as they are the key Disaster Management Agency. Both sets of codes and names have therefore been included for reporting purposes and ease of use: Administrative Boundary Levels in Madagascar: 1. Regions 2. Districts 3. Communes 4. Fokontany (Provinces/Faritany were reportedly abolished in 2007, but are still occasionally referred to) A description of attribute field explanations in the shapefiles is set out below: P_CODE: Unique Fokontany code created by UN OCHA, based on Fokontany INSTAT and BNGRC codes (includes hierarchical codes for other administrative boundaries such as Regions, Districts and Communes) FOKONTANY_NAME: Fokontany Name in Proper/Lower Case cleaned by UN OCHA FKT_BNGRC_NAME: Fokontany Name in Upper Case from the BNGRC Shapefile (FKT prefix removed for easier alphabetical sorting). (seems to correspond to Fokontany lower case names) C_FKT_BNGRC: Fokontany Code from the BNGRC Shapefile (corresponds with P-Code) COM_PCODE: Unique Commune Code created by UN OCHA (corresponds with BNGRC &amp; Fokontany Codes). C_CODE: Unique Commune Code from BNGRC shape (corresponds with COD P-Code and Fokontany codes) COMMUNE_NAME: Commune Names in Proper/Lower Case cleaned by UN OCHA ROSA BNGRC_COM_NAME: Commune Names in Upper Case from the BNGRC shapefile DIST_PCODE: Unique District Code created by UN OCHA, based on Fokontany INSTAT and BNGRC codes (includes hierarchical codes for other administrative boundaries such as Regions)-differs from the BNGRC District shapefile code below. DISTRICT_NAME: District Name in Proper/Lower Case cleaned by UN OCHA, based on District Names from the BNGRC Fokontany shapefile �DIS_FKT� (these contain slightly different hyphens � punctuation to the District Names from the BNGRC District shapefile below) BNGRC_D_CODE: District Code from the BNGRC Shapefile (DIFFERS from the P-Code and Fokontany Code Levels) BNGRC_DISTRICT_NAME: District Name in Upper Case from the BNGRC Shapefile DIS_FKT: District Name in Upper Case from the BNGRC Fokontany Shapefile (different _ underscore/hyphens and punctuation) -used as the base of the lower case COD names. REG_PCODE: Unique Region code created by UN OCHA, based on Fokontany INSTAT and BNGRC codes (differs from the BNGRC Region Shapefile code, bur corresponds with the BNGRC Fokontany code) REGION_NAME: Region Name in Proper/Lower Case cleaned by UN OCHA. BNGRC_R_CODE: Region Code from the BNGRC Shapefile (DIFFERS from the P-Code and Fokontany Code Levels) BNGRC_REG_NAME: Region Name in Upper Case from the BNGRC Shapefile REG_FKT_SHP: Region Names in Upper Case from the BNGRC Fokontany Shapefile (no hyphens � or punctuation) -used as the base of the lower case COD names. PROV_CODE: Old Province Codes from BNGRC Fokontany shapefile (Provinces were reportedly abolished in 2007) OLD_PROVINCE_FKT: Old Province Names in Upper Case from BNGRC Fokontany shapefile (Provinces were reportedly abolished in 2007) OLD_DISTRICT: Previous District Name (Antananarivo- Renivohitra district) before it was changed to Arondissement 1-6 in line with Commune level (as requested by the BNGRC). SOURCE: Data Source and Metadata The following changes have been made to the previous Madagascar COD shapefiles, based on feedback from the BNGRC: � The district shapefile has been changed to include Tana 1-6 (Arrondissement 1-6) from the commune shapefile in place of the old Antananarivo- Renivohitra district, as requested by the BNGRC. The Tana 1-6 districts were therefore re-coded, using the same P-code as the commune code (P-Codes Mdg11101001 - Mdg11101006). The communes are therefore now the district level in the old Antananrivo-Renivohitra district and the district is replaced by Arrondissement 1-6 polygons. � Added 7 missing Fokontany from the BNGRC data set that were missing from the Fokontany COD in Antanandava District, including: Antanandava; Antsirabe; Ambodirotra; Ambongabe; Bekatsaka; Ambodiapaly; and Manambato Fokontany. � Added BNGRC Region and District Codes and Names (in capital letters/upper case ), from the BNGRC shapefiles. (The BNGRC Region and District codes differ from the Fokontany code levels) , therefore over time a move should be made use the P-codes that relate to the Fokontany code levels where possible). However it is important that the CODs are in line with data the BNGRC (National Disaster Management Agency) are using, for reporting purposes. � The FKT pre-fix was removed from Fokontany names to assist with alphabetical sorting. The following duplicate P-Codes from the Fokontany (administrative boundaries level 4) COD shapefile have been corrected: ? MDG42409092006 (adjacent polygons with same name and code-renamed Antramehley I &amp; II with new code MDG42409092007, which was missing -noted in attribute metadata). ? MDG24216231002 (polygons with different names-changed one to 003 as in BNGRC shape) ANDRIAMANERO 003 and FANDRANARIVO 002 ? MDG52516152005 (duplicate ID-BNGRC data has same duplicate ID but different Fokontany names, namely Ampanaperandrotsy I &amp; II in BNGRC shape. Changed II to code 006 which was missing. ? MDG42412070007 (adjacent polygons with same name-same in BNGRC and COD data; no missing codes in commune, other than 002, therefore left as is (duplicate code remains) Therefore the following new Fokontany P-Codes have been added to the Fokontany shape: MDG24216231003, MDG52516152006, MDG42409092007 The UN OCHA COD Fokontany (admin 4) shapefile was used as the base shapefile as the Topology was clean. It is a COD requirement that administrative boundary levels nest/align with each other exactly. The OCHA COD Fokontany data (admin 4) was therefore merged/dissolved up to create the Commune (admin 3), District (admin 2) and Region (admin 1) boundary data sets, by UN OCHA ROSA, and BNGRC names and codes were joined to the dataset. *The Fokontany shapefile contains 2 missing gap polygons named �Unknown Name� (MDG14111030998 and MDG14111030999). One unknown polygon ID was changed to Fokontany 998 (from 999), so that it does not merge with the other separate unknown polygon 999, when dissolving shapefile levels. -The shapefile data is currently in a Geographic Coordination System (WGS 84). </abstract>
